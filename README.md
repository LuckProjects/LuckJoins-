This Spigot plugin is an open-source projekt. It's kinda also planned to show how easy it is to make simple plugins which normaly cost much money for quite the same content or being coded quite bad with many configs just for permissions and stuff.


***Why'd You Make This Custom Joins & Leaves Plugin, When there's Definitely Better Plugins With The Same Ideas Out There?***

This's Because I'm Making Custom Plugins That Are Not Resource Taking And isn't Complex Or Hard Just Plug In & Play!
